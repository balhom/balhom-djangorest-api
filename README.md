# Balhom DRF API

Welcome to the Balhom DRF API repository! üöÄ

This repository is the beating heart of the Balhom application, providing a powerful backend built with Django and Django Rest Framework. Our API seamlessly connects the frontend with a range of services.

## üéØ Purpose

The Balhom API is designed to handle data storage, retrieval, and processing, serving as the backbone for our application. It's the engine that powers Balhom's functionality and brings its features to life.

## üõ† Technologies Used

- **Django**: A high-performance web framework for building robust applications.
- **Django Rest Framework (DRF)**: Turbocharge your Django API with DRF for flexibility and efficiency.
- **Keycloak**: Secure your API with Keycloak for robust authentication services.
- **PostgreSQL**: Our trusty database for storing and managing application data.
- **Redis**: The multitasker‚Äîacting as a message broker and cache for optimized performance.
- **Celery**: Elevate your app's responsiveness with Celery for asynchronous task execution.
